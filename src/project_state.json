  "summary": "NuVerse is a pitch-ready “Nutech Universe” hub built as a React SPA + ICP (Motoko) backend. The frontend presents a condensed pitch shell with a guided investor stepper and a context-aware floating Create button. Primary navigation is a bottom bar across key modules (with VR reached via the AIR module rather than its own bottom-nav tab). The backend (Internet Computer canister) provides role-based access control, blob-based media handling (ExternalBlob), and APIs for profiles, social posting (with image + audio attachments), audio asset storage, NFTs, shoe products and design projects, shoe health tracking with alert notifications, live events, messaging primitives, and creator monetization configuration. Several demo modules are intentionally UI-only or locally persisted via localStorage (VR space builder drafts/publishing, creator slots, favorites/ratings/comments, avatar config and closet).",

    "Frontend is a React SPA using an internal view-state router in MainLayout (not URL routing) to switch between modules and subpages.",

    "Authentication uses Internet Identity (AuthClient) with identity restoration; the app gates between Login, Profile setup, and the main pitch shell.",
    "Backend access control is implemented in Motoko via a mixin + AccessControl module; first initializer can become admin via an env-token secret.",
    "Media payloads are represented as ExternalBlob; the frontend renders via getDirectURL() in many places and via getBytes()+ObjectURL in others.",

    "ShoewearPage calls useGetShoeProductsByCategory(activeCategory as ShoeCategory) even when activeCategory is \"shoeNFTs\", which is not a valid backend ShoeCategory.",
    "NutechBrandCreatorDashboardPage uses useState for side-effect initialization of OLED settings (should be useEffect); oledEnabled may not sync when oledSettings loads/changes.",

    "Object URLs created from blobs (avatars, thumbnails, post/NFT images) are not consistently revoked, risking memory leaks in long sessions.",
    "Avatar closet accessory IDs (acc-*) do not match XR equipment mapping accessory IDs (accessory-*), so XR accessory attachments will not resolve.",

    "There are two CSS entry files (frontend/index.css and frontend/src/index.css); only src/index.css is imported, which can confuse maintenance and theming."

  "summary": "Diff removes the VR bottom-nav tab by redefining the shared Tab union and tab list to a 5-module set (no 'vr') in BottomNav/CreateButton/InvestorFlowStepper/MainLayout, and updates InvestorFlowStepper’s sequence accordingly. However, the provided MainLayout diff is truncated, so the specific acceptance criterion about removing the 'vr' activeTab switch/case in MainLayout cannot be directly verified from the visible diff excerpt.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "MainLayout no longer includes a switch case for an activeTab value of 'vr'.",
      "reason": "MainLayout.tsx is truncated in the diff excerpt and does not show the routing/switch logic, so there is no direct evidence that any 'vr' case was removed from MainLayout’s tab routing logic.",
